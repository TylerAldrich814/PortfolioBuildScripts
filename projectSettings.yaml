#  files to the cloud.

#     - Will upload ALL files that aren't in 'IgnoreFiles' and have an
#       authorized 'Extension'
# B.) Supply "*" in "IgnoreFiles", and supply a list of 'AcceptedFiles'.
#     - This will ignore ALL files, except the files specified within
#       AcceptedFiles and files that have an authorized Extension.
